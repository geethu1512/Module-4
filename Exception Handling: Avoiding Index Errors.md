# Exception Handling in Python: Avoiding Index Errors
## Name: GEETHU R
## Register No.: 212224040089
## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that handles an **IndexError** when trying to access an element beyond the available range of a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list `list1` with some integer elements.
2. Use a **try-except** block:
   - In the `try` block, attempt to access an index that is out of range (e.g., `list1[5]`).
   - In the `except` block, catch the error and print a custom message `"You're out of list range"`.
3. Print the result based on whether the index access succeeds or fails.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
~~~
list1 = [10, 20, 30, 40]

try:
    print(list1[5])
except IndexError:
    print("You're out of list range")
~~~

## Output
![exception handling](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12a8ccfb-cc93-4e6f-a0df-c9addb9f8ac7)

## Result
Thus the program has been executed successfully.
